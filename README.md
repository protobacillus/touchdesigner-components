# touchdesigner-components

A collection of reusable TouchDesigner components

These are the available components:

- combine_rgb: combine 3 TOPs and take one RGB channel from each
- fractal_noise: a looping version of fractal noise
- progress: get a normalized progress of the timeline
- split_rgb: splits a TOP in 3, one for each color channel
- rgb_delay: delays color channels in time

The components we want to build:

- colorama: equivalent of the After Effects effect
- mirror: equivalent of the After Effects effect
- glass: equivalent of the After Effects effect
- vector_blur: equivalent of the After Effects effect
- time_difference: use difference blend mode on cached TOPs
